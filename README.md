ICBM is a Minecraft Mod that introduces intercontinental ballistic missiles to Minecraft. But the fun doesn't end there! This mod also features many different explosives, missiles and machines classified in three different tiers. If strategic warfare, carefully coordinated airstrikes, messing with matter and general destruction are up your alley, then this mod is for you!

<u>How to build:</u>
<br>
Set the two environment variables JOB_NAME and BUILD_NUMBER. For example on Windows 7 command line:<br>
> set JOB_NAME=ICBM<br>
> set BUILD_NUMBER=386-wx9.001<br>
<br>
Then use gradle to build(replace 'gradle' with 'gradlew' if you do not have gradle installed.):<br>
> gradle build<br>
<br>
There should now be a .jar in the output folder.<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>How to install:</u>
Place the jar file from your build, or which you download from 'Releases' into the mods folder.
